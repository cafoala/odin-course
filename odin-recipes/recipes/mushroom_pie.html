    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This mushroom pie is a savory dish filled with a variety of mushrooms, herbs, and cheese, all encased in a flaky pie crust. It's perfect for a comforting meal any time of the year.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pie crust (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>2 cups mixed mushrooms (such as cremini, shiitake, and button), sliced</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheese (such as Gruyère or cheddar)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they release their moisture and become tender, about 8-10 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and fresh thyme leaves.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and let the mushroom mixture cool slightly. Stir in the shredded cheese and heavy cream until well combined.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pie crust and fit it into a 9-inch pie dish. Trim any excess dough from the edges.</li>
        <li>Pour the mushroom filling into the pie crust, spreading it out evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is set.</li>
        <li>Let the pie cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy
