    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This vegetarian lasagna is made with layers of pasta, a rich tomato sauce, and a blend of cheeses. It's a hearty and satisfying dish that's perfect for any occasion.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 cups marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped spinach</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup diced zucchini</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>               

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms, zucchini, and spinach to the skillet. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, half of the mozzarella cheese, and half of the Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Layer 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread one-third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by one-third of the sautéed vegetables, and one-third of the marinara sauce. Repeat layers two more times, ending with a layer of marinara sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the top layer.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
